# Data-Science-Projects

- Implementing basic Machine Learning concepts in end-to-end projects.
- I will be working on projects that cover probability distributions, A/B Testing, EDA, machine learning algorithms, data cleaning, etc.

- To start I'll just uploading Jupyer Notebooks I have on my computer that I think will benefit from making into actual projects instead of just learning projects. Forgive me if they are all over the place, haha!
